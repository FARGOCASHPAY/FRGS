 FARGOCASH is a unique, decentralized crypto currency, which was created to work all over the world without a central authority and banks. FARGOCASH works on an independent, decentralized blockchain system. On the basis of the FARGOCASH crypto currency, the FARGOCASHPAY multi-crypto currency platform which will be implemented, is intended for online payments and crypto currency exchange around the world. The main advantage of the FARGOCASHPAY platform is support of a huge number of crypto-currencies with the possibility of paying for services and products through a simple, yet secure API connection to popular online stores, CMS systems, start-ups and ICO projects. The investor will be able to store all of his assets on the personal account of the FARGOCASHPAY platform without having to download individual wallets for each coin, with the possibility of exchanging among themselves inside the wallet. For the input of funds, as well as currency conversion, the service will charge a fixed commission; if you keep FARGOCASH on the balance sheet â€“ you get an automatic discount for trade and transfers. Two projects will be launched on the FARGOCASHPAY platform, the decentralized FARGOPAY exchange and a bulletin board with an integrated online store based on blockchain. The investor will not only be able to earn at crypto-currency auctions, but also, having FARGOCASH on his account, he will receive the maximum discount when making purchases or sales in the online store.
